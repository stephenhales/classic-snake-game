The classic snake game done only using JavaScript and HTML5

Open up the html file in the bowser of your choice and enjoy!
This game is currently hosted in Github Pages found here: https://stephenhales.github.io/classic-snake-game/snake
This was completed over the course of a few afternoons to challenge my Javascript ability as well as learn some new HTML5 concepts.
